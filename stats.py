    focused_player represented by 1, a win by the other player represented by 0, and a draw
    represented by 0.5. The second graph shows the cumulative win probability of the focused_player
    as well as their win probability for the most recent 50 games.

    focused_type is the type of player used for the focused_player. other_type is the type of player
    that was used as the opponent of focused_player.

    game is needed to see whether this was a human vs AI game, and to show this on the graph.

    Draws are counted as 'half-wins' for the player: when calculating the win probability of a
    certain player, a value of 0.5 is added to total sum of the wins for that player.

    Note: a lot of this code draws from Assignment 2.
